A deployed version of app is running at http://13.51.64.60/
The swagger is also available at http://13.51.64.60:5000/swagger/index.html
I keep the servers up and running for 2 weeks.


To run the project cd to my-api-ui
and the enter npm run dev
for the front-end to communicate with backend change the BASE_URL at /src/api.js according to the exposed port of backend.
