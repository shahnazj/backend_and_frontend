For writing this codes I got help from ChatGPT.
For example to setup a database and set the credentails or getting help for the project structure.
Since there is a certain pattern in developing different repositories, services and controllers I got inspiration
from ChatGPT and for some classes and implemented the rest by myself.
Most of the codes were repetitive and so by understanding some parts of one element I could code the rest myself.
